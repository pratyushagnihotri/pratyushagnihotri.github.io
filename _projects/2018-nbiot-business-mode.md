### üõ† Responsibilities

- Set up a **CoAP server** and enabled **NB-IoT communication** through T-Mobile‚Äôs **Cloud of Things** platform.
- Identified and analyzed the types of **CoAP requests** sent from NB-IoT modules.
- Implemented **CoAP protocol integration** with T-Mobile‚Äôs cloud environment.
- Prototyped **Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA)** update workflows for NB-IoT devices.
- Designed and built a **‚Äúbagger‚Äù business model prototype**, integrating sensors, Raspberry Pi, and cloud services to demonstrate use-case viability.
