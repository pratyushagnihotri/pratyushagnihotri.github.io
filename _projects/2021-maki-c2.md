### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

In the context of **MAKI Subproject C2**, I explore **transitions in communication systems from an information-centric perspective**. The core idea is to study and enhance **event-based systems (EBS)**, which facilitate real-time information processing by modeling data as event streams.

The goal of C2 is to **develop methods for transition-based adaptation** in stream processing engines to ensure **high quality of service** (QoS) under dynamic and heterogeneous network and system conditions.
