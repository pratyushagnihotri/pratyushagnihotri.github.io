**Researching AI. Developing Distributed Stream Processing. Impacting Systems. Educating the Next Generation.**

I recently completed my Ph.D. in ETiT department at TU Darmstadt, where my research focused on **Distributed Stream Processing**, **AI-driven Optimization Models**, and **Efficient System Design for Heterogeneous Environments**.

From June 2021 to 2024, I worked as a **Research Scientist** at the **Multimedia Communication Lab (KOM)** at TU Darmstadt, contributing primarily to the **C2 subproject** of the **DFG Collaborative Research Center [MAKI](https://www.maki.tu-darmstadt.de/sfb_maki/ueber_maki/index.de.jsp)**. Prior to his Ph.D., I worked as a **Software Developer** at **axxessio GmbH** in Darmstadt, engaging in applied research and development in the fields of Internet of Things (IoT), Smart City Solutions, and Voice Assistants.

I began my academic journey by joining the Master’s program in **Computer Science** at **TU Darmstadt** in 2013. My Master's thesis involved proposing and developing a **decentralized crowd-sensing data collection** framework based on **Information-Centric Networking (ICN)** to address **post-disaster communication** challenges. This work was conducted in close collaboration with **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Michael Zink** from the **University of Massachusetts Amherst (USA)**.

------
* Distributed Stream Processing
* Autonomous Resource Management
* Performance Benchmarking and Optimization

* Internet of Things (IoT)


Current Projects
-----
[DFG: Collaborative Research Centre 1053 MAKI](https://www.maki.tu-darmstadt.de/sfb
maki/ueber_maki/index.en.jsp) I am working as Researcher for MAKI Subproject C2 which explores transitions in communication systems from an information-centric view. A central paradigm for
information processing are event-based systems (EBS), which model the information flow as streams of events and help to recognize certain patterns over the event streams at runtime. The goal of C2 is to explore methods for transition-based adaptation of event-processing systems and thereby
achieve a significant increase in the quality of service under dynamically varying conditions.

[Parrot: Privacy Engineering for Real-Time Analytics in Human-Centered Internet of Things](https://www.maki.tu-darmstadt.de/sfbmaki/ueber_maki/index.en.jsp) I am working as Associated Researcher for Parrot project which is a collaborative research between the University of Oslo (Norway) and the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany) funded by the Research Council of Norway (2020 – 2023). The aim of this project is to find user-centric methods for real-time privacy protection for stream processing applications.
